> **Orthonormal basis** is a set of vectors that are both orthogonal and normalized.


# Getting an Orthonormal Basis

1. Start with a set of linearly independent vectors.
2. Make them orthogonal.
   1. Start with the first vector.
   2. Subtract the projection of the first vector onto the second vector from the second vector.
   3. Repeat this process for the third vector, fourth vector, and so on. 
3. Normalize them.
   1. Divide each vector by its magnitude.
   2. This makes the vectors have a length of 1.
