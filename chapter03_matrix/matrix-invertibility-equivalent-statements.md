# Matrix Invertibility Equivalent Statements


Gathering together the ways we have to detect if a matrix is invertible (or not).
Let A be a square matrix (n by n). The following statements are equivalent!
1. A is invertible
1. Determinant of A is nonzero
1. rank A=n
1. Column vectors of A are Linearly Independent
1. Column vectors of A span n-space
1. Column vectors of A form a basis for n-space
1. Av=0 has only the trivial solution (v=[x y z ...] a generic vector).
1. Av=b has a unique solution for all constant vectors b in n-space
1. The RREF of A is the n by n identity matrix.
1. A is the product of elementary matrices.
1. Kernel of A is the zero vector.
1. Nullity of A is 0.
1. A is one-to-one.
1. A is onto.
1. Range A is n-space.
1. rows of A are linearly independent.
1. rows of A span n-space.
1. rows of A form a basis for n-space.
1. 0 is NOT a stretch factor/eigenvalue of A.
1. 0 is NOT an ellipse factor/singular value of A.
