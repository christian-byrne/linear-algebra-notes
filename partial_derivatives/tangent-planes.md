## Tangent Planes

The formula for the tangent plane to a surface $z = f(x, y)$ at a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is:

$$
z = f(x_0, y_0) + f_x(x_0, y_0)(x - x_0) + f_y(x_0, y_0)(y - y_0)
$$

Where:

- $f_x(x_0, y_0)$ is the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ evaluated at $(x_0, y_0)$.
- $f_y(x_0, y_0)$ is the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$ evaluated at $(x_0, y_0)$.
- $(x_0, y_0)$ is the point at which the tangent plane is being evaluated.
- $(x, y)$ are the variables of the tangent plane.
- $z$ is the height of the tangent plane.
- $f(x_0, y_0)$ is the height of the surface at $(x_0, y_0)$.
